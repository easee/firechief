# Fire Chief Concept

## What is a Fire Chief?

The Fire Chief role is a **weekly support rotation** within software teams. The Fire Chief acts as the first line of defense to protect the team from interruptions and context switching, allowing other team members to focus on deep work.

Think of it as a tactical support role where one team member takes the helm for a week to handle incoming requests, triage issues, and ensure smooth team operations.

## Core Philosophy

The Fire Chief role embodies these key principles:

- **Shield the Team**: Absorb interruptions and context switches so others can maintain flow
- **Be the Filter**: Triage and route requests efficiently to the right people
- **Quick Response**: Provide fast feedback and resolution when possible
- **Visibility**: Ensure issues are tracked and nothing falls through the cracks

## Primary Responsibilities

### 1. Support Channel Monitoring

Monitor and respond to requests in team Slack channels (e.g., `#team-software`) and other support channels, including email and incident response.

### 2. Issue Triage

Create issues in Linear for effective tracking and follow-up. Prioritize and categorize incoming requests.

### 3. Team Assignment

Assign requests to the appropriate team members whenever possible. Leverage knowledge of team expertise areas.

### 4. Direct Resolution

Fix issues directly when you have the capability and time to do so. Be proactive where appropriate.

### 5. Team Shielding

Act as the first line of defense. Filter noise and protect the team from unnecessary interruptions.

### 6. Handover Management

At the end of your rotation, provide a structured handover to the incoming Fire Chief. Brief them on ongoing issues and any context they need.

## Time Commitment

- **Duration**: 1-week rotation periods (Monday to Friday)
- **Time Allocation**: Approximately 30-40% of working time dedicated to Fire Chief duties
- **Availability**: Monitor support channels during business hours
- **Emergency Response**: Available for critical incidents as needed
- **Handover**: Schedule dedicated time for structured handover session with incoming Fire Chief

## Key Skills Required
